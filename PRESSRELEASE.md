# Revolutionising Sustainable Fashion: Eslando Unveils Digital Product Passports for Seamless Recycling

Eslando, a pioneer in sustainable fashion technology, is proud to announce the
launch of its groundbreaking solution, Digital Product Passports. This innovative QR
code-based system is poised to transform the landscape of textile recycling by
seamlessly connecting brands, collectors, and recyclers in a unified digital
ecosystem.

Traditional textile recycling has long been plagued by inefficiencies and disconnects
between various stakeholders. Eslando's Digital Product Passports revolutionise this
process by providing a comprehensive solution that streamlines the entire lifecycle
of clothing, from production to recycling.

At the core of Eslando's solution is a user-friendly interface designed to cater to the
needs of brands, collectors, and recyclers alike. Brands can easily generate and
attach unique QR codes to their products, allowing them to track crucial data
throughout the supply chain. Collectors utilise these codes to efficiently match
garments with the most suitable recyclers, ensuring optimal resource utilisation and
minimising waste.

Eslando's Digital Product Passports represent a significant step forward in the
journey towards a circular economy in fashion. By harnessing the power of
technology and collaboration, Eslando is driving positive change and redefining the
way the industry approaches sustainability.
